## 2026-05-18 01:52 - Dev

Changed:
- Replaced the "Плохо" icon with the tighter cropped version.
- Swapped the board gap background to the softer forest/rock artwork.

Files:
- `assets/icons/bad_tight.png`
- `assets/backgrounds/soft_forest_gap_1254.png`
- `src/game.js`
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- `eventIcons.bad` now points to `bad_tight.png`.
- `.tile-icon-bad` returned to `88%` because the new source has much less transparent padding.
- Verified in the in-app browser: the new bad icon and background both load correctly.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-18 01:45 - Dev

Changed:
- Increased the "Плохо" icon by another 10%.
- Removed the manual offset so the icon centers inside the tile.

Files:
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- `.tile-icon-bad` is now `135%` with no transform; tile overflow still clips the large transparent image box.
- Verified in the in-app browser: the icon renders larger and centered in its tile.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-18 01:42 - Dev

Changed:
- Added a fantasy brown contour around playable board tiles.

Files:
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Playable tiles now have a 2px brown border plus darker/light inset shadows.
- Empty background cells stay borderless, and Joe's Shop dashed outline remains visible.
- Verified in the in-app browser: playable tiles have `2px solid rgb(111, 69, 36)`, empty tiles have no border, and tile dimensions remain equal.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-18 01:37 - Dev

Changed:
- Swapped the board gap artwork to the second adventure background.
- Increased the "Плохо" icon by another 10%.

Files:
- `assets/backgrounds/adventure_gap_2_1254.png`
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- `--board-gap-art` now points to `adventure_gap_2_1254.png`.
- `.tile-icon-bad` is now `123%` because the source image has large transparent padding.
- Verified in the in-app browser: the new background and larger bad icon render correctly.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-18 01:32 - Dev

Changed:
- Replaced the board gap sky background with the new adventure map artwork.

Files:
- `assets/backgrounds/adventure_gap_1254.png`
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- `.tile-grid` still uses `--board-gap-art` with `cover`; the variable now points to `adventure_gap_1254.png`.
- Verified in the in-app browser: new artwork appears through transparent empty cells.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-18 01:25 - Dev

Changed:
- Added sky artwork behind the board grid to replace the flat blue gaps.

Files:
- `assets/backgrounds/sky_gap_1254.png`
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Empty board cells stay transparent; `.tile-grid` now renders the sky background with `cover`.
- Verified in the in-app browser: sky art appears through the gaps and tile art remains on top.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-18 01:15 - Dev

Changed:
- Centered the "Плохо" icon visually inside its tile.
- Removed CSS grid divider lines between board cells.
- Filled empty board space with one continuous light-blue background.

Files:
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- `.tile-grid` owns the light-blue background; empty tiles are transparent to avoid seams.
- `.tile-icon-bad` has a slight transform because the source PNG has uneven transparent padding.
- Verified in the in-app browser: tile borders are 0px, empty cells are transparent, and the grid background is `rgb(217, 245, 255)`.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-18 01:10 - Dev

Changed:
- Moved door rendering anchors onto the enemy tiles.
- Door bars now sit on the enemy cell edge for all four doors.

Files:
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Door mechanics still use `enemyCell` and `toCell`; only the render anchor `cell`/`edge` was adjusted in `doorConfigs`.
- Verified in the in-app browser: all closed doors are on `.tile-enemy` cells (`1-7`, `8-3`, `3-2`, `8-0`).

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-18 01:05 - Dev

Changed:
- Locked the board grid to equal-size cells even when large PNG icons are inside.
- Expanded tile art backgrounds so gray, green, and red field art fills the whole cell.

Files:
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- `.tile-grid` now uses `minmax(0, 1fr)` tracks; `.tile` clips overflow and `.tile-icon` has fixed 100% bounds.
- Field backgrounds use `background-size: 112% 112%` to cover transparent PNG margins.
- Verified in the in-app browser: all 100 tiles report equal dimensions up to sub-pixel rounding, and tile art fills the cells.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-18 01:00 - Dev

Changed:
- Increased the "Плохо" icon so its visible size matches the "Хорошо" chest better.
- Changed start and finish cells to use the gray field art background.

Files:
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- `bad_512.png` has more transparent padding than the chest icon, so its CSS box is larger than `good` to match visual weight.
- Verified in the in-app browser: start/finish use `empty_field_512.png`, and bad/good icons look closer in size.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-18 00:55 - Dev

Changed:
- Added illustrated PNG icons for start, finish, bad, and TADAM board cells.
- Start and finish now render their own icons on the board.

Files:
- `assets/icons/start_512.png`
- `assets/icons/finish_512.png`
- `assets/icons/bad_512.png`
- `assets/icons/tadam_512.png`
- `src/game.js`
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- `tileIcons` handles non-event start/finish cells; `eventIcons` handles bad/tadam/good/shop/enemy cells.
- Verified in the in-app browser: all four new images load and fit inside board cells.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-18 00:50 - Dev

Changed:
- Replaced the "Хорошо" board emoji with a chest PNG icon.
- Increased illustrated board icon sizes by about 20%.

Files:
- `assets/icons/good_512.png`
- `src/game.js`
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- `good`, `enemy`, and `shop` cells now render PNG icons through `eventIcons`.
- Verified in the in-app browser: all three images load and fit inside board cells.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-18 00:45 - Dev

Changed:
- Replaced enemy and Joe's Shop board emoji with illustrated PNG icons.

Files:
- `assets/icons/enemy_512.png`
- `assets/icons/joes_shop_512.png`
- `src/game.js`
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Enemy and shop icons are now rendered as image HTML from `eventIcons`.
- Verified in the in-app browser: both images load at 512px source size and fit inside board cells.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 23:40 - Dev

Changed:
- Added illustrated tile art for gray route/event cells, green cells, and red cells.
- Kept start, finish, and blank board gaps on the existing styling.

Files:
- `assets/tiles/empty_field_512.png`
- `assets/tiles/green_512.png`
- `assets/tiles/red_512.png`
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Tile art is applied through CSS variables in `styles.css`; old generic tile grain is disabled for textured cells.
- Verified in the in-app browser: gray, green, red, and event tiles load the new PNG backgrounds and icons remain visible.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 19:20 - Dev

Changed:
- Removed the inline "Далее" button from action-prompt toasts.
- Action prompts now temporarily turn the main roll button into "Далее".
- Clicking the main "Далее" button resolves the prompt, hides the toast, and restores the normal roll button state.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- `showActionPrompt()` now stores an `actionPromptResolver`; `renderTurn()` uses it to switch `#rollBtn` text and enabled state.
- Verified in the in-app browser: no `.event-toast-next` remains after reload, the script cache key is updated, and no JS errors appeared.
- Verified syntax with `node --check src/game.js`.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 19:01 - Dev

Changed:
- Enlarged the wide-browser board again: `calc(100dvh - 205px)` with `880px` max.
- Reduced wide-mode board header height to 58px.
- Reworked wide-mode choice/shop popups so the overlay is no longer square and the dialog scrolls inside the available map area.
- Tightened wide-mode shop choice cards so popups fit better vertically.

Files:
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Codex compact mode remains unchanged; verified current in-app browser width `562px` still has a 72px header and 528px board.
- Verified syntax with `node --check src/game.js` and reloaded the in-app browser with no JS errors.
- External Chrome cannot be directly inspected from this Codex browser session; this was tuned from the user's Chrome screenshot plus in-app regression checks.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 18:56 - Dev

Changed:
- Enlarged the wide-browser board sizing after the first wide layout proved too conservative.
- Wide board now uses `min(100%, calc(100dvh - 255px), 820px)` instead of `calc(100dvh - 330px)` / `720px`.
- Tightened wide-mode top cards, board header, map padding, and chronicle height to give the field more room.

Files:
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Codex compact mode remains unchanged; verified current in-app browser width `562px` still has a 72px header and 528px board.
- Verified syntax with `node --check src/game.js` and reloaded the in-app browser with no JS errors.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 18:50 - Dev

Changed:
- Added a wide-browser responsive layout for viewports `1200px+`.
- Wide layout reduces player-card height, board header height, map padding, and sizes the board from available viewport height.
- Wide layout expands the app shell and right info column so regular Chrome uses more available space.

Files:
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- The Codex compact view remains under the existing `max-width: 820px` rules; verified current in-app browser width `562px` keeps the same 72px header and 528px board.
- Verified syntax with `node --check src/game.js` and reloaded the in-app browser with no JS errors.

Open questions:
- Wide Chrome should now fit substantially better, but exact browser-toolbar height can vary; tune `calc(100dvh - 330px)` if the board is still too tall/short on a specific setup.

## 2026-05-17 18:39 - Dev

Changed:
- Added the rule that landing cell effects only resolve after forward movement.
- Backward forced movement now only moves and highlights the final cell; it does not trigger that cell's effect.
- Bumped the game script cache key.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Normal dice movement and positive forced movement still resolve landing effects.
- Negative `movePlayerSteps()` no longer calls `resolveLanding()`.
- Verified syntax with `node --check src/game.js` and reloaded the in-app browser with no JS errors.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 18:31 - Dev

Changed:
- Fixed optional extra-die handling so multiple bought Joe's Shop extra-die cards each prompt separately.
- Added `1/2`, `2/2`, etc. numbering to the inline pre-roll prompt when multiple extra-die cards are available.
- The chosen extra dice now sum across all accepted cards before the roll or enemy battle.
- Bumped the game script cache key.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Replaced the old single `optionalExtraDieEffect()` lookup with `optionalExtraDieCards()` and a sequential `chooseSingleExtraDie()` flow.
- Verified syntax with `node --check src/game.js` and reloaded the in-app browser with no JS errors.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 18:25 - Dev

Changed:
- Added dashed outlines to Joe's Shop tiles.
- Joe's Shop now triggers when a player steps onto it during movement, even if it is not the final landing cell.
- After resolving the shop choice, movement continues with the remaining steps.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Pass-through shop triggers are handled by `resolvePassThroughShop()` in both normal movement and effect-based movement.
- Final landing on a shop still uses the existing `resolveLanding()` flow, so the shop is not double-triggered on the last step.
- Verified in the in-app browser: all three shop tiles have dashed outlines and no JS errors after reload.
- Verified syntax with `node --check src/game.js`.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 17:09 - Dev

Changed:
- Aligned enemy door damage thresholds with the user's numbered map: door 1 = 6 damage, door 2 = 8, door 3 = 10, door 4 = 13.
- Bumped the game script cache key.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Door positions verified in the in-app browser: door 1 `7-3/right`, door 2 `0-7/right`, door 3 `4-2/left`, door 4 `8-0/right`.
- All four doors render with two player-color dots by default.
- Verified syntax with `node --check src/game.js`.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 17:04 - Dev

Changed:
- Added personal enemy-gated doors: each door tracks which players have defeated its guarding enemy.
- Added enemy battle on landing: roll dice, apply extra dice from Joe's Shop and passive +1 roll bonuses, then compare against enemy damage.
- Set enemy damage thresholds: 1st enemy 6, 2nd 8, 3rd 10, 4th 13.
- On success, the linked door opens for that player; on failure, the player returns to start.
- Added colored player dots on locked doors and hide a door once every player has opened it.
- Blocked movement through locked doors.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Door mapping: `1-7 -> 0-7` damage 6, `8-3 -> 7-3` damage 8, `3-2 -> 4-2` damage 10, `8-0 -> 9-0` damage 13.
- Verified in the in-app browser: four doors render with two player-color dots by default, no seal text appears, and no JS errors after reload.
- Verified syntax with `node --check src/game.js`.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 16:53 - Dev

Changed:
- Moved the new central door from `4-4` to `4-2`, directly after the enemy cell.
- Bumped the game script cache key.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Verified in the in-app browser: `4-2 door-edge-left` exists and the old `4-4` door is gone.

- None.

## 2026-05-17 16:46 - Dev

Changed:
- Removed the old seal mechanic from doors and player score cards.
- Removed seal counters, seal-removal logs, and seal-related styling.
- Added a new visual door at cell `4-4` on the left edge.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Doors are now static visual gates, not seal counters.
- Verified in the in-app browser: four doors render, including `4-4 door-edge-left`, and player cards no longer show seal text.
- Verified syntax with `node --check src/game.js`.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 16:06 - Dev

Changed:
- Removed the stray trailing dot from green/red field movement action prompts.
- Changed action-prompt copy layout from grid to normal text flow so punctuation cannot become a separate grid row.
- Ensured player names keep their player color inside action prompts.
- Bumped the game script cache key.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- The dot came from the action prompt message ending after a `<strong>` element while `.event-toast-copy` was a grid.
- Verified syntax with `node --check src/game.js`.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 16:02 - Dev

Changed:
- Fixed the board action header height so it no longer grows/shrinks between normal roll state and Joe's Shop pre-roll choice.
- Fixed the roll button column width so action/info blocks do not resize when button text changes.
- Constrained the inline pre-roll action content to fit inside the fixed action block.

Files:
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Verified in the in-app browser at the current narrow width: header is 72px high, action block is 230px wide / 55px high, roll button column is fixed at 111px.
- Verified syntax with `node --check src/game.js`.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 15:57 - Dev

Changed:
- Rebalanced the board header columns so the field/card info block is narrower and the actions block is wider.
- Made the bought Joe's Shop extra-die action copy more compact.
- Tightened the inline pre-roll action controls so they fit beside the roll button without expanding the header.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- On the current in-app browser width, the field info block measured 127px and the actions block measured 230px, with a 6px gap before the roll button.
- Verified syntax with `node --check src/game.js`.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 15:43 - Dev

Changed:
- Moved the optional bought "Лавка Джо" pre-roll choice out of the modal overlay and into the actions panel left of the roll button.
- Added compact inline "Заплатить / Не платить" controls for the extra-die card.
- Bumped the game script cache key.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- During `pendingPreRoll`, `choicePanel` is now hidden and `#turnActions` renders the paid extra-die choice.
- Verified syntax with `node --check src/game.js` and reloaded the in-app browser with no JS errors in normal state.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 15:38 - Dev

Changed:
- Added a small end-game popup over the field: "Победил - X!".
- Added a short CSS confetti animation that plays around the winner popup.
- Added the winner popup layer to the board area and bumped the game script cache key.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- The popup is rendered only when `state.finished` is true and uses `findWinner()` after final coin scoring.
- Verified in the in-app browser: the hidden winner layer exists, does not block normal clicks, and no JS errors appeared after reload.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 15:22 - Dev

Changed:
- Removed the "Сейчас ходит" side card.
- Moved the party settings controls into that side-panel slot and stretched them across the available UI width.
- Bumped the game script cache key so the optional removed-card references load reliably.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Verified in the in-app browser at `127.0.0.1:5173`: the old turn card is gone, settings show 2 players / 1 die by default, and no JS errors appeared.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 15:15 - Dev

Changed:
- Removed the visible "Кольцевое поле / Ход" block from the board header.
- Expanded the dice, field info, action, and roll controls into the freed header space.
- Made the old round title DOM reference optional so removing the visible title does not break rendering.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Verified in the in-app browser at `127.0.0.1:5173`: the header controls fill the row, no JS errors appeared, and clicking "Бросить кубик" still advances into the next action flow.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 03:28 - Dev

Changed:
- Highlighted player names in game messages with the player's color.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 03:19 - Dev

Changed:
- Fixed a roll-blocking runtime error in the new turn actions panel.
- `turnActionsText` now calls the existing `optionalExtraDieEffect` helper.

Files:
- `src/game.js`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Verified in the in-app browser: clicking "Бросить кубик" moves the active token, updates the log, and advances the turn.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 03:14 - Dev

Changed:
- Removed the visible title/top setup area from the first game screen.
- Moved player count, dice count, and New Game controls below the main game content.
- Rebalanced the narrow layout so player cards, board header, and the full board fit in the visible Codex browser viewport.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- In the 599x711 in-app browser check, player cards start at the top, the board bottom measured 698px, and setup controls are below the screen.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 03:10 - Dev

Changed:
- Refit the main game screen for the user's MacBook/Codex browser viewport.
- Compressed the top project bar, player cards, board header, and board sizing in the narrow layout.
- Made the board size depend on viewport height so player cards plus the full board fit on screen.

Files:
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Verified in the in-app browser at 599x711: topbar, two player cards, board header, and the full board fit from page top.
- Measured board bottom at 692px with viewport height 711px.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 02:58 - Dev

Changed:
- Compressed the narrow-board header so the game board fits in the visible Codex browser space again.
- Changed the mobile/narrow header controls from a two-row control stack to one compact row.

Files:
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- In the in-app browser check, the header measured 66px high and the board fit within the visible viewport.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 02:50 - Dev

Changed:
- Reworked the board header controls into a compact layout that keeps the same block footprint while adding room for current-player actions.
- Added a `turnActions` area for available actions such as paying 2 coins for +1 die.
- Added a cache-busting version to the game script URL so reloads pick up fresh UI logic.

Files:
- `index.html`
- `src/game.js`
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- The visible action area is informational for now; the actual +1 die choice still appears at roll time through the existing confirmation flow.
- Browser reload could not be fully verified from shell because `127.0.0.1:5173` was not reachable there.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 02:43 - Dev

Changed:
- Added a top-of-field "Далее" prompt before effect-driven movement starts.
- Move cards and TADAM field movement now pause the turn until the player confirms the action.
- Styled the prompt as an actionable variant of the existing event toast.

Files:
- `src/game.js`
- `styles.css`
- `project-memory/updates.md`

Notes for others:
- Ordinary dice movement still starts immediately; only effect movement is paused.
- Verified the app reloads in the in-app browser with no console errors.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-05-17 02:36 - Dev

Changed:
- Updated the Joe's Shop `extra-die` card title to "Перед броском кубика можешь заплатить 2 монеты и кинуть на 1 кубик больше".

Notes for others:
